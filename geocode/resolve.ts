 * address from becoming a silent moving target: the resolution step runs
 * ONCE per employee address (like the harvester's review gate), not once
 * per paycheck. calculatePaycheck() itself still never touches the network
 * — this module only ever produces the certificate fields it already
 * accepts (workCity, county, schoolDistrictCode, workPSD, ...), it doesn't
