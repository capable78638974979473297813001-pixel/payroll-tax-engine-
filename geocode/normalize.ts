 * source) use "Bluffton", "Columbus", "Marion", "Abington", "ABINGTON TWP",

 * regex pass leaves "(balance)" behind after removing "city ".
 *
 * The type-suffix match is deliberately CASE-SENSITIVE (lowercase only) —
 * Census always appends its own type word in lowercase ("Kansas City
 * city", "Detroit city"), while a place's own NAME can legitimately end in
 * a capitalized version of the same word ("Kansas City", "Carson City",
 * "Jersey City", "University City"). A case-INSENSITIVE match here was a
 * real, caught bug: on "Kansas City city" it stripped the appended
 * lowercase "city" on pass 1 to get "Kansas City", then — because the
 * regex's `i` flag also matched the capital "City" that's part of the
 * actual name — the loop's own iteration stripped THAT too on pass 2,
 * collapsing "Kansas City" all the way down to "Kansas". Caught by a
 * failing test (tests/geocode.test.ts's Kansas City case) before it ever
 * reached the live demo, not by reasoning about it in the abstract.
