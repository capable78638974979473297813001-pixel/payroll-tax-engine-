/**
 * Taxing districts that are NOT Census geographies.
 *
 * Everything else in this module resolves jurisdictions out of Census
 * data — states, counties, county subdivisions, incorporated places,
 * school districts. That works because most local payroll taxes are
 * levied by exactly those bodies. Some are not. A regional government or
 * a transit district draws its own boundary, files it nowhere Census
 * publishes, and taxes wages inside it anyway. For those, a correct
 * address point and a perfect Census lookup still produce the wrong
 * answer — not because the geocoding failed, but because the boundary
 * isn't in the data being searched.
 *
 * This module holds point-in-district checks against the boundaries
 * those governments publish themselves. Each entry names the service it
 * queries, because provenance is the whole argument for trusting it: an
 * arbitrary polygon from a third party would be worse than admitting the
 * boundary is unknown.
 *
 * COVERED HERE:
 *   - Portland Metro's district, which is what Metro's Supportive
 *     Housing Services personal income tax is levied inside. Published
 *     by Metro itself as part of RLIS, its regional GIS.
 *   - Ohio's JEDDs and JEDZs — joint economic development districts and
 *     zones, the contractual arrangement that lets a municipality tax
 *     income earned on adjoining UNINCORPORATED township land without
 *     annexing it. There is no municipality at that address, so no
 *     amount of Census place matching will ever find the tax. Ohio
 *     publishes all 142 boundaries as a statewide service on its own
 *     ArcGIS server, keyed by the same jedd_id that
 *     data/local/OH-jedd-jedz-2026.json (downloaded from Ohio's Finder
 *     rate database) uses — so the boundary lookup and the rate table
 *     join on an ID rather than on a name, exactly.
 *
 *   - Oregon's LOCAL TRANSIT PAYROLL TAX DISTRICTS. Researched nationally
 *     first (2026-09-03): this "a district funds itself via employer
 *     payroll tax rather than property/sales tax" mechanism turns out to
 *     be genuinely Oregon-specific — no other state does this. But Oregon
 *     itself has more of it than this project had modelled: not just
 *     TriMet and LTD, but Canby, Sandy, South Clackamas (SCTD), and
 *     Wilsonville (SMART) all levy the same kind of employer excise.
 *     Checked each of Oregon's OTHER transportation districts (Basin
 *     Transit, Grant County, Hood River County, Lincoln County, Rogue
 *     Valley, Salem/SAMTD, Sunset Empire, Tillamook County) directly and
 *     confirmed they fund themselves via PROPERTY TAX, not payroll —
 *     verified for Tillamook ("a property tax levy of twenty cents per
 *     thousand assessed valuation"), Hood River County ("local property
 *     tax, fare revenue... Federal and State funds", no payroll mention),
 *     and Basin Transit ("roughly 30% of its funding from a local
 *     property tax rate... the BTS Transportation District" — its
 *     "payroll tax" mentions turned out to be Oregon's existing STATEWIDE
 *     transit tax, already modelled as OR_STT, not a district-specific
 *     one). The remaining three (Grant County, Lincoln County, Sunset
 *     Empire) share the same rural-county-district profile as the
 *     confirmed three and were not independently re-verified one-by-one —
 *     disclosed as pattern-matched, not exhaustively primary-sourced,
 *     unlike the three that were.
 *
 *     Found ONE unified live source for the payroll-tax-funded ones: the
 *     Oregon Department of Transportation's own statewide "jurisdictions"
 *     layer (gis.odot.state.or.us) carries every Oregon transportation
 *     district — payroll-funded and property-funded alike — as named
 *     polygons with a JRSDCT_TYP=6 ("transportation district") code.
 *     oregonTransitDistrictAtPoint() below queries it and maps the
 *     PAYROLL-FUNDED subset (TriMet, LTD, SCTD) to this engine's
 *     certificate.locality values, while deliberately never matching the
 *     property-funded ones even though they're the same layer — setting
 *     locality for one of those would fabricate a payroll tax that
 *     doesn't exist. This REPLACES two earlier, separate approaches: LTD
 *     used to be resolved against RLID's own regional boundary service,
 *     and TriMet used to be resolved against a vendored copy of its own
 *     KML boundary file with a hand-written point-in-polygon check (both
 *     worked, both are now redundant with this one statewide source,
 *     which additionally removes the vendored file's own refresh
 *     commitment entirely — a live query never goes stale).
 *
 *     Canby's district is NOT in the ODOT layer above — checked directly,
 *     genuinely absent — because Canby's own transit tax boundary is NOT
 *     the "Canby" city-limits polygon that layer's JRSDCT_TYP=1 entries
 *     hold; it's the Canby URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY, explicitly described by
 *     Canby's own transit-tax guide as "the Canby Urban Growth Boundary –
 *     an area including and extending somewhat beyond the city limits of
 *     Canby." That's a different, genuinely separate boundary type, so
 *     isInsideCanbyTransitDistrict() below queries Oregon's own statewide
 *     UGB layer (published by DLCD, the Department of Land Conservation
 *     and Development) instead. Sandy and Wilsonville, by contrast, ARE
 *     simply their own city limits (confirmed directly from each city's
 *     own transit-tax guide) — so those two need no special boundary
 *     lookup at all; they're resolved the ordinary way, through Census
 *     incorporated-place matching, the same as Denver's or Seattle's
 *     local taxes.
