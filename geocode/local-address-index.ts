/**
 * A LOCAL address-point index, queried instead of the network.
 *
 * This is the answer to a gap that no amount of retrying the National
 * Address Database fixes. NAD is aggregated from states that volunteer,
 * and a 5km-box probe over each city (measured, not assumed) found ZERO
 * NAD points in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Pittsburgh, Honolulu, Las Vegas,
 * Manchester, Charleston, Boise, Jackson and Miami — while Philadelphia
 * and Hartford are dense. Contribution is county-by-county even within
 * one state.
 *
 * OpenAddresses collects the same authoritative local files directly from
 * counties, so it carries much of what NAD never received. Built into a
 * SQLite index by scripts/build-address-index.ts.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
 *
 *   1. It does not decide which point IS the address. It returns the
 *      neighbourhood; rooftop.ts's matchAddressPoint() applies the
 *      house-number, directional, street-type and unit guards it already
 *      has. Keeping that judgement in one place is the point — two
 *      matchers would drift apart.
 *   2. It does not claim national coverage. OpenAddresses is voluntary
 *      too: New Hampshire, for instance, ships only five towns and
 *      Manchester is not among them. An empty result here is a genuine
 *      "not published", not an error, and the caller falls through to the
 *      network tiers exactly as before.
 *
 * Absent index file = absent tier. Nothing breaks; the pipeline behaves
 * as it did before this existed, which is what makes the index optional
 * for anyone who does not want 5GB of extracts on disk.
