/**
 * A SECOND, independent, free geocoder — OpenStreetMap's Nominatim — used
 * only as a cross-check against census.ts's result, never as the primary
 * source of truth. Two independently-built systems agreeing is real
 * evidence; the whole point here is that Census and OSM are maintained by
 * different organizations from different underlying data, so they don't
 * share a blind spot. Disagreement doesn't mean either one is WRONG — it
 * means a human should look, the same review-gate ethos this project's
 * harvester and every FieldMatch in resolve.ts already use.
 *
 * This does NOT itself close the rooftop-precision gap — OSM's address
 * data is crowd-sourced and interpolated in many of the same ways
 * TIGER/Line is. What it buys is a genuinely independent second opinion.
 * The precision gap is closed elsewhere and by different data: rooftop.ts
 * resolves government-surveyed address points from the National Address
 * Database, and index.ts prefers those coordinates when they exist. This
 * module's job is unchanged either way — asking a second system whether
 * the address even resolves to the same PLACE.
 *
 * Nominatim's own usage policy (https://operations.osmfoundation.org/
 * policies/nominatim/) requires: an identifying User-Agent, an absolute
 * cap of 1 request/second, and no heavy/bulk use — this module enforces
 * the rate cap itself (throttle()) rather than trusting every caller to
 * remember, since a caller doing this at onboarding time for one employee
 * address will never approach the limit, but nothing stops a future
 * caller from looping over many at once.
