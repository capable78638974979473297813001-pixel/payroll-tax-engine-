/**
 * ROOFTOP PRECISION — the thing census.ts's own doc comment said this
 * project could only flag, never fix.
 *
 * Census's geocoder INTERPOLATES: it finds the street segment whose
 * address range contains the number and places a point proportionally
 * along it, at the curb. For "90 W Broad St, Columbus, OH" that lands 58m
 * from the building the address actually names (City Hall) and 23m from a
 * completely different one (LeVeque Tower). Near a municipal or school
 * district line, that error is the difference between withholding the
 * right local tax and the wrong one.
 *
 * What a paid geocoder has that this project didn't: authoritative
 * ADDRESS POINTS — one surveyed coordinate per real address, produced by
 * the county or state that assigns the addresses in the first place
 * (usually for E911 dispatch, where sending the ambulance to the curb
 * two doors down is a real problem). Those points are not proprietary.
 * The US DOT aggregates them into the NATIONAL ADDRESS DATABASE, ~98
 * MILLION address points contributed by state, local, and tribal
 * governments, published free and queryable point-by-point through a
 * public ArcGIS feature service. No key, no license, no bulk download.
 *
 * On the same Columbus address, live: NAD returns 39.962431,-83.003328 —
 * which sits 3.9m from City Hall's own traced building footprint, versus
 * Census's interpolated point 58m away next to the wrong tower. That is
 * rooftop precision, on free public data, in one HTTP call.
 *
 * IMAGERY closes the loop. OSM's building footprints (buildings.ts) are
 * polygons traced from satellite imagery — many of them machine-detected
 * by Microsoft's and Esri's computer-vision models and imported
 * wholesale; the Columbus footprints this was tested against literally
 * carry `source=esri/Franklin_County_OH_Buildings` tags. So an address
 * point can be checked against a building detected from imagery: if the
 * authoritative point lands ON a mapped structure, that is two
 * independent systems — one surveyed, one seen from orbit — agreeing on
 * where the building is. `confirmedOnBuilding` below is exactly that
 * check, and it is the automated form of the satellite-photo inspection
 * that started this whole line of work.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITS, measured rather than assumed (see the coverage numbers
 * in this project's own commit for this module):
 *   - COVERAGE IS NOT UNIVERSAL. NAD is voluntary: states and counties
 *     contribute what they have, so some areas are dense with points and
 *     others have none at all. Where there's no point, this returns
 *     `found: false` and the caller keeps Census's interpolated result —
 *     the precision is address-by-address, not a blanket upgrade.
 *   - A point is only as good as the government that submitted it. Most
 *     are structure-placed; some are parcel centroids or driveway access
 *     points. NAD's own `Placement` field says which, when the submitter
 *     populated it (Ohio's, for one, ships "Unknown").
 *   - This is positional precision, not address VALIDATION. A typo'd or
 *     nonexistent address doesn't become valid because no point matched.

 *                      honestly better than a TIGER range, not rooftop.
 *   'osm-corroborated' — OSM holds a house-level point for this address
 *                      AND it agrees with Census's own position, so two
 *                      independent systems place the address there.
 *                      Crowd-sourced: good, not authoritative.
 *   'parcel-centroid' — a COUNTY government's own tax-parcel polygon (not
 *                      NAD, a separate registry — see parcel.ts's own doc
 *                      comment) matched this address and its area passed
 *                      a "single building, not a whole campus" size gate.
 *                      Weaker than 'authoritative' — a legal boundary's
 *                      centroid, not a surveyed structure point — but

 * resolveRooftop() checks 'authoritative-neighbors' BEFORE
 * 'osm-corroborated' for exactly that reason: a tight NAD bracket (both

 * against a loose one) is built from real surveyed government points,
 * which is a better kind of evidence than a crowd-sourced point merely
 * not disagreeing with Census's own rough interpolation — verified this
 * matters live: 210 Capitol Ave, Hartford, CT sits 200m from a real NAD
 * bracket (numbers 168 and 223) that used to lose to OSM's corroborated
 * point purely because OSM was checked first, not because it was better.
