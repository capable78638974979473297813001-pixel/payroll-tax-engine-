/**
 * Live network calls to the Census Bureau's own free, public geocoding
 * services. Deliberately kept thin — everything that can be tested without
 * a live HTTP round-trip lives in resolve.ts/normalize.ts instead, the same
 * split harvester/harvest.ts uses (fetch is a parameter there; here, fetch
 * is confined to exactly these two functions and nothing else in this
 * project ever calls them at paycheck-calculation time).
 *
 * Two SEPARATE Census services are needed, not one:
 *   1. geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder — address string -> lat/lon plus
 *      States/Counties/Incorporated Places/County Subdivisions. This is
 *      the ordinary "geocoder" most integrations mean by the word.
 *   2. tigerweb.geo.census.gov/.../tigerWMS_Current/MapServer/identify —
 *      school district boundaries are NOT included in service #1's
 *      response at any benchmark/vintage tried (confirmed empirically this
 *      session — Unified/Elementary/Secondary School District layers came
 *      back empty even on vintages that documented them). TIGERweb's
 *      generic identify operation, queried at the coordinates service #1
 *      already returned, is what actually has them (layers 14/16/18).
 *
 * HONEST LIMITS, not fixed here because they can't be without a paid
 * service this project deliberately doesn't depend on (see README's own
 * "zero dependencies" stance):
 *   - This geocoder INTERPOLATES a point along a street segment's address
 *     range rather than using surveyed rooftop coordinates. For an address
 *     genuinely near a jurisdiction line, that can occasionally place the
 *     point on the wrong side. matchQuality.addressRangeWidth (below) is
 *     the honest signal for THIS module's own output — a WIDE range means
 *     less positional confidence, not a guarantee of correctness.
 *     NO LONGER THE WHOLE STORY: rooftop.ts now resolves an authoritative,
 *     government-surveyed address point for addresses the National Address
 *     Database covers, and index.ts prefers that point over this one when
 *     it exists (measured on this project's own demo addresses: 15 of 18).
 *     Where NAD has no point, everything above still applies exactly as
 *     written.
 *   - No USPS CASS certification. normalizeAddress() below does cheap,
 *     genuinely useful cleanup (whitespace, secondary-unit stripping for
 *     the retry fallback) but is not a full address-correction service.
