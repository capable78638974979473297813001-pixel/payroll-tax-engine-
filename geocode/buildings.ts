/**
 * A THIRD, genuinely automated cross-check, added after discovering (by
 * hand, with satellite imagery — see nominatim.ts's own doc comment for
 * why that can't be the shipped feature) that Nominatim itself can be
 * confidently wrong: for "90 W Broad St, Columbus, OH", Nominatim placed
 * the address 0.56 miles away, on top of a real but entirely different
 * building (COSI, across the river), while Census's own point landed
 * correctly near the actual building (Columbus City Hall). A place-name
 * agreement check wouldn't have caught that — both geocoders "matched",
 * they just matched different things.
 *
 * What DOES catch it, and IS a real function (not a photo needing a human
 * or an LLM to look at it): OpenStreetMap separately publishes actual
 * TRACED BUILDING FOOTPRINT polygons — real structure geometry, drawn by
 * volunteers from imagery over years, independent of Nominatim's own
 * address-search index (a different OSM subsystem entirely, queried via
 * the Overpass API rather than Nominatim's endpoint). Many of those
 * footprints carry `addr:housenumber`/`addr:street` tags. This module:
 *
 *   1. Fetches every tagged building within ~150m of a resolved point.
 *   2. Finds the nearest one ON THE SAME STREET as the address being
 *      geocoded, and reads its house number.
 *   3. Compares that number against the ADDRESS BEING GEOCODED'S OWN
 *      house number. A large gap (Nominatim's case: the nearest building
 *      on W Broad Street was tagged "500" against a target of "90" — a
 *      410-number gap) is real, cheap, deterministic evidence the point
 *      landed somewhere numerically implausible for that street. A small
 *      gap (Census's case: "50 West Broad Street" against a target of
 *      "90" — 40 numbers, effectively next door) is reassuring, though
 *      not proof — street numbering isn't perfectly linear everywhere.
 *
 * The SAME-STREET restriction matters and is not decoration: the single
 * nearest building to a downtown point is often on a cross street (at
 * Census's own Columbus point, the third-closest footprint is "25 South
 * Front Street"), and comparing house numbers across two different
 * streets compares nothing at all. Numbers are only ever compared within
 * one street; when no footprint on the target street is tagged nearby,
 * this check reports no signal rather than a made-up one.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: this catches "far enough away that the house numbers
 * don't line up", not "close enough that the wrong building was picked
 * anyway." If the wrong building sits directly next to the right one
 * with a similar house number, this check won't catch it — no visual
 * inspection substitute exists here (see nominatim.ts's own doc comment
 * again: that requires an actual trained model, not achievable in this
 * project). Coverage is also uneven by design: OSM's building footprints
 * are dense downtown and sparse in rural areas, so many addresses get no
 * signal at all from this. It's a real, additive signal, not a
 * replacement for anything else this module already does.
