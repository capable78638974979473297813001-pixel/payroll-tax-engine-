/**
 * The minimum wage side of this engine.
 *
 * Everything else in src/ answers "what comes OUT of a paycheck." This
 * module answers the one question that constrains the paycheck before any
 * of that happens: how low may the hourly rate itself go.
 *
 * The whole calculation is one rule, and it is DOL's own: where federal,
 * state and local minimum wage laws all cover the same hour of work, the
 * employer owes the HIGHEST of them. That is why the data is stored one
 * level at a time in data/minimum-wage/ and merged here at query time,
 * rather than pre-flattened into a single rate per address — a pre-merged
 * table silently loses the reason a number is what it is, and goes stale
 * one jurisdiction at a time without anything noticing.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating plainly, because they are where naive
 * implementations go wrong:
 *
 *  - TIPPED pay is a separate ladder, not a discount on this one. Where a
 *    jurisdiction allows a tip credit, its floor is a CASH wage; where it
 *    does not (California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington,
 *    Alaska, Guam, and Flagstaff AZ), the full rate is owed in cash. The
 *    highest-applicable rule applies to the cash floors independently, so
 *    a tipped answer is never derived from the standard answer.
 *
 *  - EMPLOYER SIZE genuinely changes the answer in a dozen jurisdictions,
 *    and the size tiers are not all the same shape (headcount in Burien,
 *    headcount-or-revenue in unincorporated King County, gross receipts in
 *    Ohio, seasonality in New Jersey). Only the headcount tiers are
 *    machine-readable; where a tier is not, this module says so in the
 *    trail instead of guessing at it.
