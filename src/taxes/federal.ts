 * attached to. This function used to tax the raw, un-reduced

 * 401(k) deferral, and a $5,000 bonus, it taxed the full $5,000 at 22%
 * ($1,100) instead of the correct $3,500 ($500+$5,000−$2,000 = $770),
 * over-withholding by $330. Fixed by capping the taxed amount at
 * ctx.taxableWagesFor()'s own combined net base — algebraically equal to
 * Math.min(fullBase, supplementalCash) (proof: federalIncomeTax()'s own
 * REGULAR-side taxableWages is atLeastZero(fullBase - supplementalCash);
 * fullBase minus THAT already equals min(fullBase, supplementalCash) in
 * every case — no pretax exceeding regular, pretax exceeding regular but
 * not the combined total, and pretax exceeding the combined total too).
