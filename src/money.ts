/**
 * BUG FIX (found auditing this engine for a different class of bug — see
 * taxes/state.ts's own resolveCertBoolean() history): a malformed numeric
 * certificate field (a typo, a wrong type from a JSON API caller, an
 * upstream bug) commonly reaches here as `Number(cert.someField ?? 0)`,
 * which produces NaN rather than throwing for anything non-numeric —
 * `Number("abc")` is NaN, not an error. NaN then propagated through this
 * engine's two universal arithmetic chokepoints in two different, both
 * dangerous ways: roundHalfUp() let it flow straight through (`raw >= 0` is
 * false for NaN, so the false branch ran and returned NaN, eventually
 * surfacing as `null` once a TaxLine.amount serializes to JSON — a
 * confusing failure, but at least a visible one) — while atLeastZero() was
 * FAR worse: `cents > 0` is ALSO false for NaN, so it silently returned 0,
 * meaning a single malformed field (say, certificate.exemptions: "two"
 * instead of 2) could make a whole state's income tax line report a
 * confident-looking $0 with no error at all. Verified live: a Wisconsin
 * calculation with certificate.exemptions set to a non-numeric string
 * produced a $0 WI_SIT line with a detail string reading "less $NaN.NaN
 * exemptions (NaN x $400)" — visible on close inspection, but the actual
 * `amount` field gave no indication anything was wrong. Guarding these two
 * functions closes the gap at its single highest-leverage point: every
 * numeric certificate field in this engine eventually flows through one or
 * both on its way to becoming a TaxLine, so this is enforced once here
 * rather than needing a parallel fix at every individual `Number(cert.x ??
 * 0)` call site (there are dozens).
