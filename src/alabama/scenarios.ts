/**
 * A catalogue of Alabama payroll scenarios this engine can now calculate,
 * each one exercising a genuinely different rule rather than a different
 * dollar amount of the same rule. Not a test suite — tests/engine.test.ts
 * already proves the arithmetic against the booklet's own worked examples
 * — this is a runnable reference for "can it do X", built for the pass that
 * added the 5% supplemental option, the severance exemption, the exempt
 * employment categories and the federal-law exemptions on top of the
 * existing formula/local-tax engine.
 *
 * Every scenario is a complete AlabamaPaycheckInput. Run one with
 * calculateAlabamaPaycheck() (or `npm run demo:alabama` for all of them at
 * once) and read the `alabama.explanation` / `warnings` arrays alongside
 * the numbers — that is the part a dollar figure alone doesn't show.
