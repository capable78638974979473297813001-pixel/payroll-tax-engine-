/**
 * The Alabama input/output surface.
 *
 * The engine's own PaycheckInput is deliberately national and deliberately
 * low-level: integer cents, a federal W-4 in full, and a `certificate` bag
 * whose shape changes state by state. That is the right shape for the
 * engine and the wrong shape for someone who has an Alabama payroll to run
 * and an Alabama Form A-4 in front of them.
 *
 * So this layer is the Alabama one: dollars instead of cents, the A-4's own
 * five exemption codes instead of a free-form certificate, a work city
 * instead of a local-tax lookup key, and — the part that matters most — a
 * set of validations and warnings that know what Alabama actually does.
 * Everything here converts down to PaycheckInput and calls the same
 * calculatePaycheck() every other state uses; nothing here re-implements a
 * tax.
 *
 * MONEY IS IN DOLLARS at this boundary (3218.50, not 321850), because these
 * inputs are written by hand and read by people. It becomes cents on the
 * way in, once, in input.ts, and comes back out as all three
 * representations so nothing downstream has to guess which one it is
 * holding.
