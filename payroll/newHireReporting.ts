 * workforce agency for the state where the employee works, primarily so
 * child-support income-withholding orders can find them. Required data
 * elements and the 20-day federal default deadline are fixed by the
 * federal statute itself; a state MAY require faster reporting (several
 * do), which this module does not attempt to enumerate — see
 * `deadlineDaysForState()`'s own doc comment for why that's disclosed
 * rather than guessed, the same choice this project makes everywhere it
 * hasn't done the per-state legal research (README.md's own Known gaps).

 * report a few days later than a stricter state technically allows, never
 * later than federal law's own outer bound. Closing this properly means
