 * an already-approved, persisted PayRunLine (payroll/run.ts's own

/**
 * Rolls one paycheck's result INTO the running year-to-date totals the tax
 * engine itself needs for its NEXT calculation — every wage-base cap
 * (Social Security, FUTA, a state's SUI/SDI/PFML/LTC), every threshold
 * (Additional Medicare, Oregon's Portland-area local triggers), and the
 * few oddly-shaped trackers (RUIA's MONTHLY reset, Iowa-shaped annual
 * garnishment caps live in the caller's own order records instead) all
 * depend on a caller who remembers what came before. calculatePaycheck()
 * itself is deliberately stateless — see its own header comment — so this
 * is the layer of a real payroll company that keeps the ledger.
 *
 * DESIGN: every rule below adds a TaxLine's own `taxableWages` field to the
 * matching bucket, never `amount`. That is deliberately not an
 * approximation — underCap(current, ytd, cap) (money.ts) returns exactly
 * the slice of THIS period's wages that newly became taxable, so summing
 * `taxableWages` across periods telescopes to the correct cumulative
 * figure by construction, whether or not a cap ever binds.
 *
 * DEDUPING SHARED TRACKERS: several states run an employEE line and an
 * employER line off the SAME wage-base tracker in the SAME calculation
 * (e.g. NJ_UC_EE and NJ_SUI_ER both read/write ytd.stateUnemployment.NJ;
 * WA_PFML_EE and WA_PFML_ER both read/write ytd.statePaidLeave.WA). Both
 * lines are computed from the identical (currentWages, ytd, cap) triple
 * within one calculatePaycheck() call, so they are mathematically
 * guaranteed to report the same taxableWages — this accumulator groups by
 * (bucket, key) and adds each group's figure exactly ONCE, never sums the
 * two lines together (which would double-count the wage base every period
 * a state has both sides configured).
 *
 * DISCLOSED, NOT SOLVED HERE — two real trackers this function does not
 * attempt, because the information to derive them correctly does not
 * survive into a PaycheckResult's TaxLine array at all:
 *
 *   - ytd.seattleCompensation needs the employee's FULL per-period Seattle
 *     compensation, including the portion below the per-employee
 *     threshold — but seattlePayrollExpenseTax() (taxes/state.ts) reports
 *     only the IN-BAND slice as `taxableWages`, and returns no line at all
 *     once an employee is entirely below threshold. A generic accumulator
 *     reading only the TaxLine array has no way to recover the excluded
 *     portion. A caller actually running Seattle payroll must track this
 *     total itself from the same taxableWagesFor() figure the engine used
 *     — exactly the same "caller-supplied, never guessed" discipline the
 *     engine already applies to input.employer facts.
 *   - Kentucky's per-jurisdiction SS-wage-base credit (Walton, Florence)
 *     tracks city and county HALVES separately under
 *     ytd.localIncomeTax['KY_LOCAL_<Name>'], but the two halves are
 *     combined into ONE 'KY_LOCAL' TaxLine with one combined amount —
 *     there is no way to split it back apart from the output alone. A
 *     caller using this feature must track each jurisdiction's own running
 *     total directly.
 *
 * Both are exceedingly narrow (one city, two Kentucky municipalities) next
 * to the 50-state surface this function does cover correctly, and are
 * disclosed here rather than force-fit — the same tradeoff README.md's own
 * "Known gaps" section makes throughout the engine itself.
