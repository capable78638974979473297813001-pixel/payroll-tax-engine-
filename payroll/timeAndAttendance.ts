/**
 * Turns raw clock punches into the classified regular/overtime/double-time
 * hours payroll/engine.ts prices into a paycheck — the layer between "an
 * employee clocked in and out" and the flat regularHours/overtimeHours a
 * TimeEntry expects.
 *
 * SCOPE: this models the two overtime shapes that actually exist in US
 * law — a plain federal weekly-40-hour test (FLSA, every state that hasn't
 * enacted its own daily rule), and California's own daily 8/12-hour and
 * 7th-consecutive-day rules (Cal. Labor Code § 510) — because those are
 * the two this project could verify against a primary source. A handful of
 * other states (Alaska, Nevada, Colorado) have their OWN daily or
 * consecutive-day variants; those are NOT modelled here, the same
 * "disclosed, not force-fit" choice this project makes everywhere it
 * hasn't done the legal research yet (see README.md's own Known gaps).
 * `overtimeRuleForState()` falls back to the federal rule for every state
 * it doesn't have an explicit rule for, which is the correct floor (no
 * state's overtime law is EVER less protective than FLSA) even where it
 * understates a state's own stricter daily rule.
