 * Offboarding: when the final paycheck is legally due, and what happens to
 * an unused PTO/vacation balance — two questions state law answers very
 * differently depending on WHY someone left, which federal law does not
 * answer at all (FLSA sets no final-paycheck deadline; it requires only
 * that wages actually due be paid, generally read as no later than the
 * next regular payday).
 *
 * SCOPE, same discipline as payroll/newHireReporting.ts's own per-state
 * deadlines: California is researched and cited (Cal. Labor Code
 * §§ 201-203, 227.3) because it is the single most consequential and
 * most-cited case (immediate pay on involuntary termination, a HARD ban
 * on ever forfeiting earned vacation). Every other state falls back to
 * the federal floor — "next regular payday," "PTO payout follows the
 * employer's own policy" — which is the safe direction to be wrong in:
 * several other states have their own final-pay or no-forfeiture rules
 * this project has not yet researched state by state.
