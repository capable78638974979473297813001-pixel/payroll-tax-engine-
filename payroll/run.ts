/**
 * Orchestrates a pay run across every active employee of a company for one
 * check date — the actual "run payroll" button. payroll/engine.ts computes
 * one employee at a time; this module is what makes it a RUN: who's
 * included, the draft/approve/void lifecycle, and rolling approved results
 * into each employee's running YTD so the NEXT run sees them.
 *
 * A run is DRAFT until approved. Calculating a draft (or recalculating it
 * after fixing a time entry) never touches an employee's stored YTD —
 * only approvePayRun() does, exactly once, which is what makes "run it,
 * notice an hours error, fix it, run it again" safe: nothing is committed
 * until a human signs off on the numbers.
