/**
 * Recruiting through hire: a job posting attracts candidates, a candidate
 * moves through pipeline stages, an accepted offer becomes exactly the
 * Employee record payroll/run.ts already knows how to pay — the moment a
 * full HCM platform's "recruiting" module hands off to its "payroll"
 * module, made explicit as one function (hireCandidate()) rather than a
 * manual re-entry step.
 *
 * SCOPE: pipeline tracking and the hire handoff. No job board posting
 * integration, background-check/I-9 verification workflow, or offer-letter
 * document generation — those are real, separate systems, the same
 * "disclosed, not built" boundary this project draws around benefits
 * carrier EDI and e-filing elsewhere.
