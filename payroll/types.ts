 * The payroll domain model — everything a payroll run needs that the tax
 * engine (src/) deliberately does NOT know about: who the company and its
 * employees are, what they're paid, where their money goes, and what
 * happened the last time payroll ran. The engine stays a pure per-cheque
 * function (`calculatePaycheck(input) -> result`, no state, no employee
 * records — see src/types.ts's own PaycheckInput); this module is the layer
 * a real payroll company runs on top of it: employee/company records, a pay
 * schedule, YTD accumulation ACROSS pay runs, direct deposit, and paystubs.
 *
 * This is where "which state's rules apply" (src/registry.ts) stops and
 * "whose money is this and where does it go" starts.
