 * code the way DirectDepositAccount does here — it goes straight into a

 * same boundary site/lib/store.ts's own header comment draws for card
 * numbers. This module works with account numbers directly because it has
 * no such vault to call — building one is infrastructure, not a payroll
 * calculation, and is out of scope here the same way a live database
 * connection is (see payroll/store.ts's own header comment).
